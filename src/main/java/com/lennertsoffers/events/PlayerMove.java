// Listener is an interface just used for tagging classes

// ---- Not explained in the course but to give you a better idea of how the Listener works ----
// Every class tagged Listener is read by the pluginHandler on the server
// Every class that implements Listener should have precisely one method annotated with "@EventHandler"
// Because the Listener interface doesn't have any methods in it, the name of the method doesn't matter
// The pluginHandler will read all classes that implement the listener with reflection and search the EventHandler method
// This method will then be subscribed of the HandlersList of the Spigot event you give as an argument
// If the event occurs, this EventHandler method is called
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
